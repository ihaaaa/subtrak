# 📌 Subscription & Recurring Payment Tracker (SubTrak)

SubTrak is a simple and smart web app built during this hackathon to **track and manage subscriptions** in one place.  

With so many OTT apps, gym memberships, SaaS tools, and other recurring payments, people often **forget about active subscriptions**.  
This leads to **unexpected deductions, overdrafts, and money loss**.  

Our project solves this problem by giving users a **single dashboard** where they can:
- ✅ Add their active subscriptions manually.
- ✅ Automatically detect subscriptions from SMS/bank data *(planned)*.
- ✅ Get reminders before renewals and trial expirations.
- ✅ See a summary of total monthly and yearly spending.
